ere complied from ArmA II sound files and stock sounds from ambient-mixer.com, and spliced together by me.

This mission is a fictional creation. It is not intended provide a historical account at any time period. All characters, places, and geopolitical conflicts are
fictional and any resemblence to actual people, places,or events is entirely coincidental. This is a mission designed to tell a good story, nothing more.

This MAY be the first mission in a series, depending on whether I decide I want to do it or not. The mission was created to push my development skills further than any 
other mission has before.
