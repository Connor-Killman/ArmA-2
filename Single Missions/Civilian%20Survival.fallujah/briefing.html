<! ------End1------>
The U.S. was attacking Fallujah, although I hated having to rely on outside help, I have to say the U.S. had impeccable timing. If they did not start their attack when they did, then I would be dead, and so would Faiza, Amani, Kameel, and Sabeer.

My dearest Faiza, I thought I could protect you. I was wrong. After losing you, I could not go on. Kameel, Sabeer, Amani and I escaped Fallujah, but the damage had been done. I wanted to leave the region. Kameel tried to get me to become one of the leaders of the resistance but I refused. Amani begged me to stay and fight for Fallujah, in the memory of you. Sabeer was surprisingly silent. I expected him to try everything he could to force me to stay and lead the resistance, but he did not. He simply told me that I was making a mistake, which running from problems was not the way to handle them. He reminded me of my mothers’ words from when I was a kid. But there is something about that statement that both Sabeer and my mother left out. To fight your problems, you must have strength. After losing you, I had none. The battle in Fallujah was a great victory for the Unites States, but I was already gone. I had control of my empire, I used it to leave the region before officially turning it over to Kameel. I didn’t go to Germany,  I could not face my family for years after your death, so instead I headed to America, the country that had saved my city because I could not save it, or you, myself. I am writing these letters to you because I still blame myself for your death. You were right there behind me every step of the way, depending on me, believing that I would bring you out of Fallujah and I could not. I let you die. I have not been doing so well, to be honest. These American doctors say I have an extreme case of depression, and these letters should help me get my feelings out and maybe allow me to return to a normal life. Kameel, Sabeer, and Amani still try to help me support myself, to face my problems once again, but I still do not have the strength. Occasionally they will fly into America and visit me. When they do can see that they pity me, a mere shell of a man, of a friend, of a husband. I still get some money from Kameel, but it does not go as far in America. The empire still grows beyond Fallujah, and has created an unprecedented time of peace, in the city, and continues to stabilize other regions around it. I know I should get a job, clean up my home, find a hobby or two. But I cannot. You were always by my side, guiding me, supporting me. I still do not know how to do this without you. I cannot. So, for now, we will see how these letters work, if they work at all. Expect more from me soon. -Your Husband.

"...We managed to make it out of Fallujah, but it was not without its losses. Kameel was hit on the way out. We all just stood over his body, trying to wrap our heads around what happened. Killing UMF soldiers was different, they were attacking us, we had to kill them or be killed ourselves, we did noy have to think about it nor did we want to. But to lose someone whom you consider family, shakes your whole world up. Kameel and I did not share blood, but he was family just the same. He cared for Faiza when I was away and managed my empire when I was with Faiza. Amani was hit especially hard by the loss. The city was burning around us, but we did not care. Finally, Sabeer picked up his rifle, and started walking towards what resembled the beginnings of a front line between the UMF and U.S. forces. We tried to stop him, Amani pleaded with him to return, said she could not lose both brothers in single day. Sabeer looked back at Amani for a moment, but then looked at me and said "Take care of her. Get them out of here, keep them safe with your life." Faiza and I, we had to drag Amani out of Fallujah. We never saw Sabeer again. Without Sabeer or Kameel to help manage my empire, it became too much for me to handle alone. When it collapsed, I knew that I had to get Faiza and Amani out of the region. Faiza, Amani, and I all went to live in the United Kingdom, I have family in Germany, but Faiza and Amani were able to find jobs quickly in England. That is my story. One of war and of loss. The U.S. stabilized the region and saved my Fallujah, when I could not, but it was already too late, I will always love my Fallujah, but I also love Faiza and Amani. I told Sabeer I would keep them safe, and that is what I intend to do. Besides, England is starting to grow on me. Thank you." - Speaker at the 2005 United Nations Conference on Stabilizing Contested Regions and the Ethical Treatment of Refugees.

<h2><a name="Debriefing:End4">Sabeer, Goodbye</a></h2>

Sabeer, when you died, you took a little of each of us with you. We all froze when you fell to the ground, but Kameel, calm as ever, took charge and snapped us back to reality. He led us out of Fallujah while the rest of us in despair. He was my rock for so many years, but his betrayal hurt Amani the most. Despite being the smartest of all us, he was blinded after your death. After Fallujah, the resistance leaders pooled their resources to fight the UMF head on. Kameel lost hope in the resistance, he was convinced that the UMF would destroy us if we waged war against them. He just wanted the war to end as quickly as possible. He hid his pain behind a face of stone, never really allowing himself to grieve for you. Even Amani couldn't break through the Façade. By the time we realized just how much he had been hurt, it was too late. When we planned our first major offensive against the UMF, he secretly told them everything under the promise that no one would be killed. I know why he did it, but for someone so brilliant, he was such a fool to trust them. When we attacked, they slaughtered everyone. The ones who managed to get away came back to our camp, to safety. Or so they thought, because Kameel had also told the UMF where our base was. The UMF descended on our base with everything they had; we never stood a chance. I was with Faiza on the outskirts of the camp when the attack hit and was able to get way. On top of a hill, we watched, helpless, through binoculars as they dragged Kameel and Amani out into the courtyard and showed them what Kameel had done. Amani was horrified upon learning that Kameel was the informant. The officer took great pleasure in telling her everything Kameel had done. I watched through the binoculars and saw her begin to cry, in anger at Kameel, in fury at the UMF, in sadness for all the lives lost that day. But the UMF need one last life. In horror, we watched was the UMF officer raised his pistol, and shot Amani through the heart. What I would have done for a sniper rifle then. Kameel dropped to his knees and held her in his arms as she died.  Despite his betrayal, she still loved him and gave him one last kiss. In the end, the UMF decided to honour their agreement and capture Kameel. They dragged him from Amani’s body kicking and screaming. Broken, in shock, and in dire need of counseling, Faiza and I held each other that night. Unsure of what to do. In the morning we departed from that hill made our way towards Germany to be with my family. Only after the U.S. managed to defeat the regime during a war that took much longer than it should have had the locals resisted the UMF did we find out what happened to Kameel. The UMF took horrible records but it was enough to piece together that after only three days in prison, Kameel killed himself. Believing that he had killed me and Faiza along with Amani and the rest of the camp, Kameel fashioned a noose from his bed sheet. Faiza and I wept that day. Years later, Faiza and I still go to counseling once a week. This letter was supposed to go in your casket at your funeral, but I could not bring myself to finish it until now. Maybe this is a sign that we are healing. I think Faiza and I’s love for each other is the only thing that gets us out of bed in the morning, which encourages us to live our lives to the fullest every day. Through the counseling we have learned to focus on the positive things in life. As a result, we are happy, but in living we also make every day a memorial to you, to Amani, to all those fighters in the war, and yes even to Kameel. I have said goodbye to everyone else but you Sabeer. I could not bring myself to tell you what your brother had done. But now that I can write you this letter, that is exactly what this is. So goodbye Sabeer, I will love you as my brother always, good luck in whatever your endeavors may be, may you find yourself love and happiness. Goodbye.

“…Through the chaos, the bullets whizzing the rockets flying, I still remember which one it was. The bullet brushed the hairs on my arm and the sharp crack of a gunshot filled the air. Sabeer dispatched the UMF soldier was it was too late. I looked back and saw the surprise on Amani’s face as the blood began coming out of her chest, that memory is burned into my brain. Kameel quickly laid her down and tried to stop the blood, but it was no use. Amani was dead within minutes.” “Was she able to say anything before she died?” “Yes, before she died, she told us to go on, get out of Fallujah, live so someone would remember her.” “And what did you guys do once she was dead?” “Faiza was in tears, Sabeer punched a wall, and my legs could no longer hold me; I fell to the ground, bracing myself against a wall. (silence) But Kameel, he just stared at her for thirty seconds. That was all he gave himself, thirty seconds to grieve, to process. He stood up, grabbed his rifle and continued told us we needed to continue on. I still do not know how he did it, but he got us to continue pressing through the city until we were out.” “After witnessing such a close member of your family died, how did you cope?” We made camp that night and before I went to sleep, I remember, I could hear Kameel and Sabeer weeping together in their tent. It was good that they still had each other, as Faiza and I did.” “What did you do after that night, your home had been attacked, and someone you loved killed. Surely you didn’t let that slide.” “(chuckle) No, we did not. Amani was a catalyst, her death inspired us fight. We made sure that the UMF would pay. Eventually, we made it into the mountains, where we contacted other members of the resistance and created a reasonably sized force. We started our offensive within the week and attack major assets of the UMF while the U.S. met their forces head on. We all remembered Amani and dedicated ourselves to the cause in her name. Her death was what gave us the unbreakable spirit we need to prevent others from sharing a similar pain.” “You said the U.S. played a part in the war, could you elaborate?” “Yes, the U.S. was a major force, capable of taking on the UMF forces in a conventional war. The resistance was much smaller and relied heavily on guerrilla tactics. While we went behind enemy lines and cut their supply lines, the U.S. carried out operations on a far grander scale and fought UMF on the front lines. I have no doubt that the Americans would have won eventually, but it would have been more costly for them and for the citizens of Fallujah.” “What did happened after you took back Fallujah?” “Eventually, the Americans liberated Fallujah, and we joined the U.S. forces and made one final joint attack on the last remaining UMF bunker holding the UMF leaders. After the battle, The U.S. set up a provisional government and started to pull out its troops, eventually leaving only a skeleton force.” “As I’m sure you know, Fallujah is once again under the rule of an oppressive regime. What happened” “Only three years after the war, a new regime gained enough power to overthrow the government and plunge the region into chaos once more. Sabeer, Kameel, and I were too tired to fight another war. We had lost too many people, and too many pieces of ourselves fighting the last one, starting with Amani. I had to abandon my beloved Fallujah; I was no longer capable of protecting it. We fled. In sorrow, and pain, and misery, we fled.” “That couldn’t have been easy. What happened to Kameel and Sabeer?” “Kameel and Sabeer went to Croatia to work. Amid the beautiful landscapes, Sabeer was able to find himself love. We went to his wedding only, what? Two years ago? Yeah. Kameel unfortunately died of heartbreak three years ago. The official reason for his death was his heart simply gave out, stopped working. Kameel… Kameel never truly got over Amani. He lived, yes, but without Amani, and without a home, he just did not have the spark anymore.” “The spark?” “Yes, the drive to live to push forward. Everyone has one, something that they live for. For some people that is money, greed, fame, success, power. For others it is curiosity, innovation, knowledge. For all of us, it was love and home. We all lost our home. Faiza and I already had each other, and Sabeer was able to find someone he loved, but Kameel lost both, and he could not regain it either.” “How are you and Faiza holding up?” “Faiza and I, well we are you know… content, here in Germany. It is no Fallujah, but for the moment my Faiza is here and so, its home.” “Do you have any final thoughts you wish to share with our viewers? “Things could have gone so much better in Fallujah, that day Amani died especially. I guess what I have to say is… Hold on to what you hold dear, do not let it go. Focus on what is important in life. I lived through a war to protect what I loved; most people do not have to do that. Right now, call your husband, wife, sister, brother, parent, cousin, tell them you love them do not wait. And if you ever have to fight, I mean truly fight, know exactly who or what you are fighting for. Good luck to you.” “Cut… Thank you. It was inspiring to meet you and hear your story. And to learn exactly what you think matters most in this world.” “No problem… I just hope that I was able to help somebody out.” “It’s been an honour to meet you.” (Shakes Hands) “Dave, I thought I told you to cut.” – Best of 2006 Amateur Documentary: Tales of Valour: The Story of the 2004 Liberation of Fallujah
