player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["An End", "It was a nice day in Fallujah. Calm, which in Fallujah still carries quite a bit of chaos. I took the morning off work to spend some time with my wife. Kameel, Amani, Sabeer, came over for lunch, but unfortunately, I had some crucial business to attend to after lunch. I had to finalize the details of a smuggling run which included High Value Target. The HVT had been harassing the UMF for years and they finally found him. He needed a new safe house where he could continue his operations. I knew the meeting wouldn't take long and so told Kameel, and Sabeer to stay with Faiza and Amani. The meeting went well, and the details were finalized. Me and two of security advisors left and started walking around the city to discuss recent movements of UMF resources in their attempt to find me. I don't know how, but ironically UMF found us. I thought it was someone in that meeting, I still do. But then all I could do was look into the barrel of a rifle. I later found out that everybody in that meeting was dead, and after reviewing my empire, I didn't find any other signs of betrayal. The squad that captured us lined us up against a wall. I felt a weird sense of pride as I stood there with my advisors. Pride in what I had accomplished, in how I had defended my city and my family. If my family was safe, I knew that someone else would take care of my home, nothing else mattered. But then, in cruel twist was fate, the officer in charge of the squad said that they had other targets they needed to kill and nodded at me with a chuckle. Faiza! The UMF would kill anyone associated with their enemies. Faiza, Kameel, Amani, and Sabeer were in danger. I had to save them, but I didn't have the means to. Still, I dashed at the officer and quickly received a rifle butt to the skull. I was dragged back to the line and told to stand. The squad then left, leaving only two soldiers to carry out the execution. Apparently, the officer of the squad didn't like seeing the execution and told the soldiers to catch up when it was done. I remember thinking "" No... I've failed you, Faiza, my love. I'm sorry, I couldn't stop them. I couldn't save you."" Then, the cock of a rifle pierced the air. Staring into that barrel, I was convinced that this would be my end."]];
player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["A Few Small Victories", "Some more years past, I received letters from my family, telling me they were settled and safe. They ended up in Germany and found it better than they ever could have imagined. I was also able to secure Faiza's father's blessing and he let us be wed. Faiza, now my wife, and I, her husband. I also continued my scams, but this time, they had a much more noble purpose. I used the funds I got to secure weapons, and to bribe officials into letting certain things that harm Fallujah go. I stopped trade embargo's, I secured transport for certain individuals who would weaken the UMF's choke hold on Fallujah. I was able to do it, without giving up my identity, allowing me to protect Fallujah, and Faiza. I continued my work, becoming a weapon's dealer, smuggler, and organizer of various missions that weakened the UMF's grasp; waging war, without firing a shot. But it didn't go unnoticed. The UMF considered me their biggest threat, so large was my empire, but they didn't find me, not for years. The UMF wasn't then only ones looking for me. I became something of a celebrity in the underground fight against the UMF. My business boomed, to control it, I formed a close circle of advisors which had my trust and respect. These advisors each had their talents in one aspect of my empire, but two of my advisors became more than just business associates, they became family. Kameel and Sabeer were brothers, but they couldn't be more different. Kameel, was quiet, and patient while Sabeer was more boisterous and shorter tempered. Together, they were able to consider many different courses of action that I would have never thought of. But away from my empire, Kameel and Sabeer were the only ones who were welcomed into my home. Kameel even had a wife, Amani, and Faiza at once took a liking to her with her. Together, we openly discussed what issues plagued us, and like a true family, we all defended each other from whatever threat tried to destroy us. What's more, the U.S. was also beginning to have an interest in the region. Luckily for us, the UMF had a history of ""mistakenly"" attack U.S. soft targets which meant the U.S. would be glad to get rid of a thorn in their side. The gains made by me and other resistance leaders against the UMF had caught the United States' attention and they had offered me support on occasion, particularly with extracting notorious people from the area. I didn't know what exactly their goal was, but their support proved to be quite helpful. I considered them an ally in this war of mine, but I kept a watchful eye."]];
player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["A Choice", "Over the years, I got much closer to Faiza, I grew to love her with all my heart, and despite her father's objections, she loved me too. But a problem arose, the newest ""liberation movement"" had just overthrown the latest oppressing regime, but it became clear that this new one was going to crack down on illegal emigration. They called themselves the United Militia of Fallujah (UMF) and they still had to rebuild the government before they could become effective; I knew that I didn't have much time, I needed to get me and my family out. I never stopped my childhood antics, I only got better at scamming people, and better at hiding it. As a result, I had amassed a sizable amount of money, but it still wouldn't be enough, not if I wanted to bring Faiza. I know I would be able to convince my family to leave, and the disapproving looks I would receive from my mother would be nothing if I could make sure she was safe. I organized transport for them and made sure they could get out, but I had a choice to make, leave with my family, or stay with my love, Faiza. I spent the day thinking about it, but in the end, knowing my loved ones were safe was all that mattered. My family would be safe, I made sure of that, but I couldn't defend Faiza if I ran too. That day, I finally understood what my mother meant all those years ago. I knew I would have to make sure that Faiza was safe, and I knew that my true problems came not from Fallujah, my beloved city, but the invaders and the impostors who killed my neighbors in the name of Fallujah. I would stay, and I would fight. So long as I have something worth protecting, I would protect it with all my might. My dear Faiza, and my city Fallujah, I would die for you."]];
player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["A Beautiful Lily", "When I got older and entered my teenage years, I was still very much the little boy determined to uproot my family to go live elsewhere, but one thing stopped me in my tracks. I beheld the most beautiful sight. One day when I was on the beach, I saw the most gorgeous woman, I immediately fell head over heels for her. I did the only thing I did the only thing I could think to do in that moment: I picked up a nearby flower, a lily of all things, and walked over to her. I said ""Excuse me, I know that I can't possibly show you anything that could resemble the beauty you possess, but if this lily is even half as beautiful as I can see you are, then I might be able to give you a pretty good idea."" She was wary at first, why wouldn't she be? A weird stranger just handed her a flower saying she was the most beautiful person in the world. I'm sure my star-stuck jaw-open lack of response when she said ""Thanks..."" didn't help matters either. But, somehow, I convinced her to spend the day with me. She told me her name: Faiza, she hated it, but it only made me like her more. I learned that it was only her first week in Fallujah, her family had risked everything to get here hoping for a better life. That day ended well for me, because before she left to go home, she told me where she lived, and that she might be willing to meet me again. Of course, the next day I went over first thing in the morning, much to her dismay as her dad saw me and instantly knew of my interest in his daughter."]];
player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["A Little Boy", "I've lived in Fallujah since I was just a little a boy Living with my family, I knew we had more than other families did, but I also knew that our life was horrible compared to the lives lived by people in countries like China, the United Kingdom, Canada, and America. I knew that these places didn't know war like I did. And I wanted it. Growing up, I used to scheme and con people out of their money so I could take my family out of this place. When I told my Mother, she was furious, demanded that I pay everybody back. She said ""Stealing is not the right way, to succeed, you must work hard and stay the course, else you are only bound for failure. You cannot run from your problems my dear boy, but you must face them head on."" Of course, I didn't know what she meant at the time, nor did I care. I continued to stockpile what money I could so that one day, I could bribe my family's way out of here. If only I had the wisdom I have now."]];
player createDiaryRecord ["Diary", ["A City of War", "Fallujah has been the scene of many massive battles. Being the most important city in the heart an unstable region, many regimes and ""liberation movements"" have clashed over control of the city. For decades, the people of Fallujah have had to watch their heads, else a stray mortar shell relieve them of it. You would think that such conflict would spur people away from the city, but you would be wrong. Fallujah, despite its constant need for repairs, is also home to one of the few places in the region with running water, and easy access to a river for trade. War also afflicts the rest of the region, so for citizens who cannot afford to leave the region flock to Fallujah for what they consider to be a better life."]];
